# Assignment 3 for 370.062 OSESM by Julius Bergmann

In this homework we should work with the MESSAGE-ix framework and add a PV-system to the westeros tutorial.

## Results
The goal was to simulate at what carbon cap all three electricity generation types (coal, wind and pv) are used.
This could not be achieved because wind is so cheap that in simulation only wind power is installed.
I tried to limit the growth of the generation types, but the simulation crashed, when the value was below 8%.

So sadly this is the result.
